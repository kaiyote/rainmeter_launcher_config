rainmeter_launcher_config
=========================

A node-webkit desktop app to enable to simple configuration of a Rainmeter widget I wrote.  I've been too lazy to release the actual widget anywhere (and there are likely much better offerings than mine), but this application is designed to, and will only, work with that Rainmeter application.
